            href="https://leca.osug.fr/">(LECA)</a>. My research covers a wide range of topics, from studying the spatial dynamics of ecological models to analyzing food webs and exploring eco-evolutionary models. However, all these areas share a common feature: they fall within the realm of theoretical ecology, whether from the perspective of numerical modeling or contemplation of conceptual questions. <br>

            For instance, the framework of my thesis <i>"Modelling part-whole interactions in ecology and evolution, spatial structure and multilevel selection"</i> lies in materialist dialectics, a subject specific to conceptual thinking but also guiding the formalization of models in ecology, evolution and biology. Thus, I can assert that I am interested in both conceptual issues and the technical challenges associated with modeling. This reflects my preference for discovering new themes rather than specializing in a particular field. <br>
            
            Professionally, I am equally enthusiastic about leading research projects as I am about contributing as a modeling engineer.

            <div> In the absence of top-down and bottom-up controls, herbivores eventually drive themselves to
              extinction by exhausting their host plants. Poorly mobile herbivores may experiment only local
              disappearance, because they can recolonize intact plant patches elsewhere, leaving time to previously
              over-exploited patches to regrow. However most herbivores such as winged insects are highly mobile, which
              may prevent the formation of spatial heterogeneity. We test if long-distance dispersal can preclude
              coexistence using the invasion of box tree moth (Cydalima perspectalis) in Europe as a model system. We
              build a lattice model and estimate the parameters with a combination of field measurements, experimental
              data and literature sources. Space corresponds either to a realistic boxwood landscape in the Alps, or to
              theoretical landscapes of various sizes. We find that both species persist under a large range of
              realistic parameter values, despite a severe reduction in boxwood biomass, with an alternation of
              outbreaks and near-to-extinction moth densities. Large landscapes are necessary for coexistence, allowing
              the formation of spatial structure. Slow plant regrowth combined with long-distance dispersal could drive
              moths to extinction, because of resources depletion at the global scale even without a complete
              synchronization of the local dynamics. The spatial dynamics leads to formation of small plant patches
              evenly distributed in the landscape, because of a combination of local plant dispersal and global indirect
              competition between plants through their positive effect on moth population size. Coexistence is favoured
              by such heterogeneous landscapes, because empty patches increase moth mortality during dispersal: the
              system thus creates its own stability conditions.</div>

            <div> The evolution of mutualism between hosts and initially parasitic symbionts represents a major
              transition in evolution. Although vertical transmission of symbionts during host reproduction and partner
              control both favour the stability of mutualism, these mechanisms require specifically evolved features
              that may be absent in the first place. Therefore, the first steps of the transition from parasitism to
              mutualism may suffer from the cost of mutualism at the organismic level. We hypothesize that spatial
              structure can lead to the formation of higher selection levels favouring mutualism. This resembles the
              evolution of altruism, with the additional requirement that the offspring of mutualistic hosts and
              symbionts must co-occur often enough. Using a spatially explicit agent-based model we demonstrate that,
              starting from a parasitic system with global dispersal, the joint evolution of mutualistic effort and
              local dispersal of hosts and symbionts leads to a stable coexistence between parasites and mutualists. The
              evolution of local dispersal mimics vertical transmission and triggers the formation of mutualistic
              clusters, counteracting the organismic selection level of parasites that maintain global dispersal. The
              transition occurs when mutualistic symbionts increase the density of hosts, which strengthens competition
              between hosts and disfavours hosts inhabiting areas dominated by parasitic symbionts: mutualists construct
              the ecological conditions that allow their own spread. Therefore, the transition to mutualism may come
              from an eco-evolutionary feedback loop involving spatially structured population dynamics.</div>

            <div> Phenotypic plasticity has important ecological and evolutionary consequences. In particular,
              behavioural phenotypic plasticity such as plastic foraging (PF) by consumers, may enhance community
              stability. Yet little is known about the ecological conditions that favor the evolution of PF, and how the
              evolutionary dynamics of PF may modulate its effects on community stability. In order to address these
              questions, we constructed an eco-evolutionary model in which resource and consumer niche traits underwent
              evolutionary diversification. Consumers could either forage randomly, only as a function of resources
              abundance, or plastically, as a function of resource abundance, suitability and consumption by
              competitors. PF evolved when the niche breadth of consumers with respect to resource use was large enough
              and when the ecological conditions allowed substantial functional diversification. In turn, PF promoted
              further diversification of the niche traits in both guilds. This suggests that phenotypic plasticity can
              influence the evolutionary dynamics at the community-level. Faced with a sudden environmental change, PF
              promoted community stability directly and also indirectly through its effects on functional diversity.
              However, other disturbances such as persistent environmental change and increases in mortality, caused the
              evolutionary regression of the PF behaviour, due to its costs. The causal relationships between PF,
              community stability and diversity are therefore intricate, and their outcome depends on the nature of the
              environmental disturbance, in contrast to simpler models claiming a direct positive relationship between
              PF and stability.</div>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Trophic Cascade Paradigm’s Complex Reality: The Role of Large-Order Indirect Interactions
              (In Prep.) </h3>
            <div class="subheading mb-3"> <b>Léo Ledru </b>, Jean-François Arnoldi, Arnaud Sentis, Victor Frossard</div>
            <div>The trophic cascade, a fundamental ecological concept, posits that a predator exerts a positive
              indirect effect on a resource via its negative impact on a consumer. This concept has received empirical
              recognition, with observations frequently aligning with its predictions. However, there exist numerous
              instances where biological systems deviate from the expected trophic cascade dynamics. Explanations for
              these deviations are often attributed to idiosyncratic factors, such as complex trait-based interactions.
              From the analysis of food webs either generated by niche models or empirical, we strive to provide a more
              comprehensive explanation for trophic cascade failures by investigating large-order indirect effects. We
              present evidence that in systems where these indirect effects are non-negligible, they can disrupt the
              trophic cascade, leading to its failure. This disruption may result in the attenuation of the cascade
              within isolated trophic chains or even its inversion when considering broader trophic food webs. We show
              that the trophic cascade concept is more robust in its community-cascade form than in its species-cascade
              form. Yet, it becomes intricate to view food webs solely as linear trophic chains, as this
              oversimplification obscures potential deviations from the cascade concept at the species level.
              Furthermore, our study challenges the conventional definition of a trophic cascade by demonstrating that
              its failure can stem from interference with indirect effects originating from the cascade itself. This
              research not only enhances our understanding of trophic cascades but also underscores the importance of
              considering large-order interactions in ecological studies.</div>

Furthermore, I show that taking into account these larger-order indirect effects can lead to interferences with the trophic cascade. Thus, we suggest that significant larger-order indirect effects may be a general cause for cases where the trophic cascade does not manifest as expected in food webs. </span> </p>

                  The objective is to propose theoretical ecology topics, with mathematical and numerical analysis, but
                  with a playful visual.
                  It also allows me to develop my skills in programming and 3D animation, a field I really enjoy
